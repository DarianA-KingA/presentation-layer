# presentation-layer
The presentation layer mainly translates data between the application layer and the network format. And then, after knowing the actual meaning, here I am introducing you a project made by no one but myself.  

# program content 
when you read the repository's name you might think this is an actual all-structured program, which is not the actual case. The real case is that this is program only-presentation-layer-based where you could see the graphic meaning of the presetation-layer statement.

# modules of the program 
there're only two modules, such as: 

  - text editor. 
  - background changer.
